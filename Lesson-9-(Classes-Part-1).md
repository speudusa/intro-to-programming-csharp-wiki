# Lesson 9: Classes Part 1

## In the prep work for this lesson, the students learned:

1. What a class is in C# and how instantiating classes creates objects in Visual Studio.
1. Review the difference between fields and methods.
1. Understand the keyword `this`
1. What access modifiers are and how modifiers can be used to encapsulate data.
1. How to use constructors to instantiate objects
1. What the Single Responsibility Principle is and why we should make our classes responsible for one thing.

## Announcements

1. Check with your course manager for any additional announcements.

### Full-Time Students

* Welcome to Day 13
* Some afternoon work time for Assignment 2 on Day 14
* Assignment 2 due at end of Day 15

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

1. Live code to explore working in Visual Studio
    1. Review how to create a new solution and project
    1. Demo how to add a class to an existiting project
1. Live coding demo of the keyword `this`, creating constructors, and instantiating objects

### Lesson 9 Topics That Require Careful Attention

1. The differences between classes and objects can be confusing for some students.
1. Object-oriented Programming, encapsulation, and the Single Responsibility Principle can all be very confusing and hard for students to envision.
    1. Take time to review examples that follow these principles and ones that do not.
    1. Taking time to review can be helpful for students who are struggling to understand the impact that following OOP can have on class design.
    1. This is also a good segue into the studio.
1. When demonstrating code, be sure to highlight auto-implemented properties! Using this feature can be tricky, but once students master it, coding classes in C# becomes a bit more efficient!

## Lesson 9 Studio TF Notes

1. Pace the studio carefully. Students will start by designing their own classes, but also need ample time to share their class design with their partners.
1. If the group is an odd number, either pair with the student who doesn't have a partner or make one group a group of 3.
1. This studio can be very subjective. Encourage students who are not following the principles of OOP to think about the reading and see if they can better encapsulate their data.
1. No matter if their design is perfect, they will need some time at the end to code their designs. The important part here is to make sure their code matches their design, not that their code perfectly matches what you think it should be.
