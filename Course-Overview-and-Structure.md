# Methodology

## Blended Learning

The course is delivered using a combination of online tasks, face-to-face instruction, small peer group time, and programming assignments. The varied delivery is meant to reinforce the concepts by accommodating different learning styles.

## Flipped Classroom Model

Most of the traditional instruction will be done at home via online reading and exercises. In class time will be spent reviewing concepts, answering questions, walking through live-coding examples, and working on small programming tasks called studios.

## Course Goals

Teach students, from wide ranging backgrounds, these topics:

* Learn how to learn (learning mindset)
* Problem solving skills
* Basic programming using C#
* Introduction of web development concepts

This content is meant to be a start and not the finish. With these skills students can proceed into more complex areas.

# Class Structure

* Prep work
  * Tasks student do **during assigned reading time**
  * Inlcudes:
    * Reading chapters
    * Completing concept checks
    * Working on/completing exercises

* Primary Instruction
  * Led by the instructor
  * Includes lecture and live coding examples
  * Recap prep work as needed

* Studio
  * Students separate into assigned groups
  * Group work with TF check-ins
  * Designed to be **safe practice time** for students with TF support
  * Class discussion and review as needed

* Graded Programming Assignments (Graded Assignments)
  * Completed independently
  * Graded assignments for which students are given multiple weeks to complete
  * Typically worked on outside of class, unless provided "open working time" by TF

* Self-Assessments (Full-Time classes only)
  * These assessments are scheduled to provide feedback for the student about what concepts they understand and what they need to review.
  * These are not graded, and will not prevent a student from passing the class.
  * Use these to assess overall class understanding of concepts.  
  * The time spent on these self-assessments is split between students working on the assessment without their notes and comparing their answers to the solution guide. In Canvas, the corresponding solution guide is in Pages and should be published as students work on the self-assessment. This way students can access the solution guide as soon as they complete the questions.
  * We have made this [guide](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki/blob/master/wiki-materials/Self-Assessment-Guide.pdf) for students on best practices for the self-assessments. Remind students to open it up in Canvas before they start reviewing their answers for each self-assessment.

# Tasks and Responsibilities
Instructors and TFs are crucial to the success of the students. These tasks help ensure that everyone knows
their role in the process.

## Instructors

* Report Issues to LaunchCode (LC) staff
  * Contact LC staff by Slack, email, or phone.
  * LC staff needs to know about issues with: students, TFs, facilities, curriculum, course tools
    * [For issues requiring changes to the curriculum material, including bugs](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki/Course-Overview-and-Structure#Bug-and-Issue-Reporting)

* Facilitate large group(full class) activities
  * Examples
    * What to review/demo in primary instruction
    * Decide whether to bring the class back together after studio time
    * Decide whether to hold a TF standup after class

* Monitor and respond to student struggles
  * Look for signs of students struggling and falling behind
  * Use feedback from students and TFs to determine how to cover the topic more effectively.
  * Adjust examples and descriptions of topics as needed.

* Serve as knowledgable resource for TFs.

## Teaching Fellows (TFs)

TFs will be assigned a group of students to guide.

* Assist individual students
  * Check on each student in your group at least once every class
  * Answer individual student questions
  * Help an individual student through a code problem

* Monitor and respond to individual student struggles
  * Ask how the student feels about the current topic? Do they understand it?
  * Look at student submissions to see if the are attempting quizzes, exercises, and studios.

* Facilitate studios and other small-group activities
  * Deliver the activities listed in Canvas

* Grading
  * TFs are responsible for verifying student work and entering a grade into Canvas

* Feedback
  * Provide the students specific and timely feedback on assignments, studios, and tasks
  * Provide ideas to the LaunchCode staff on how to make the course better

## Students

* Pay attention to assignments in Canvas
* Do the prep work **during alloted class time**
* Attend class and participate in activities
* Turn in graded assignments on time
* Do their own work

## Bug and Issue Reporting

Students should notify their TA or instructor of any issues they find in course materials (typos, bugs, etc). Course staff should assess the issue and gather as much info as possible. If the issue is indeed with course materials (some student concerns are the result of misreadings, bad student code, etc) then then they should raise the issue with the Education Team. To submit an issue, do one of the following:

- Email the Ed Team at education@launchcode.org
- Create a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-programming-csharp/issues)
