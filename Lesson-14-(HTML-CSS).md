   1. Note tedious aspects as they appear (e.g. making EVERY h2 red), and note that we will learn how to streamline this process in the next chapter.
1. Reinforce why using a VS is a good idea. If you have a personal story that relates to this, feel free to share it!
1. Studio intro. Task uses browser developer tools.
1. Graded Assignment #4 is open! Remind students that the key to getting the assignment done is to read through everything carefully and start on what you can do as soon as possible. In class, read through the instructions with your students and highlight what they are capable of doing after this lesson topic.

### CSS Topics That Require More Attention 

1. Review the differences between using element selectors, class selectors, and id selectors in CSS.

1. Studio intro.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Finding the dev tools for their particular browser version.
   1. Using copyrighted images. This is a good time to remind your students that just because something is found on the web, that does NOT mean it's free to use. If in doubt, DON'T. The safest bet would be to stick to personal images.
1. Encourage having fun! Ooooh and aaaaah as you check in with each of your students.
1. Remind your students to keep their new headlines light-hearted. The studio page has some good language around this, but you should comment on this as well.
