## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Topics That Require More Attention

1. "So THAT's what '404' means!" De-mystify one or two common HTTP errors.
1. There is a lot of nitty-gritty detail in the HTTP chapter. Note which parts are the most essential for new coders to understand.
1. Review the differences between GET and POST. Why should one method be used over the other?
1. Live coding:
    1. Show how changing ``type = "text"`` to ``type = "email"`` adds basic validation to an HTML ``input``.
    1. Difference between ``radio``, ``select``, and ``checkbox``.
    1. How to align multiple labels and inputs:
        1. Horizontally,
        1. Vertically,
        1. Centered within a ``div``.
1. If time allows, discuss why basic HTML forms (inputs, buttons, etc.) do not usually look like the ones we see on company websites.
1. Studio intro.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
    1. There is a fair amount of text that comes before the actual studio instructions. Gently redirect your students to this information if they try to launch right into the task.
    1. The starter code contains JavaScript DOM elements - these enable the website to be dynamic once the HTML is created. Students should not 
    touch this code.  Students need to make sure that any naming conventions presented in the textbook are used as they are part of the JavaScript.
    1. Be ready with syntax reminders for adding attributes and properties inside the HTML tags.
    1. Aligning the input box, labels, radio buttons, and the "Go" button can be frustrating, especially for perfectionists. Be ready with tips for nesting these elements.
